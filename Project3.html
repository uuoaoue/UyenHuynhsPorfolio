    <h1>I'll quit Zoom</h1>
    <p>2021 <br>

The year 2020 became a tremendous change to most of our life. Everything changed rapidly from working to travel. In addition to that, how quickly education had to adapt to this exceptional situation is worth mentioning.

Students are sent home during the middle of the semester and
must adapt to learning virtually. Before the pandemic, it was hard to visualize how
remote work and online communication would become a curial part of our life. However,
it has been more than a year and online conferencing, as well as virtual classes, have
become more and more popular than ever before.<br>
"I'll quit Zoom" is the project utilizing Procreate and Adobe Premiere Pro to  share my experience and thought about the impact of

the pandemic on our daily life.

<br>
The immediate shift to online studying during the COVID-
19 pandemic has a negative effect on self-perceptions, in my opinion. As an introverted,

I feel comfortable staying at home, but I also want to socialize with other people
sometimes and I think the virtual environment has its limitation about this. Moreover, the
more time I spend studying on Zoom, the more hurtful my eyes are, and it also worsens
my headache. The impact of online learning has been affecting my mental health
radically. On the other hand, in this project, I must also acknowledge some privileges of
being online such as barely be late for class even though I do not have to wake up early
every day to travel to school.
<br>
 Overall, this project is a

self-reflect for me about a time that has become an important period of our history and
an opportunity to express my experience.
