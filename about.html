    <h2>About me</h2>
 <p>Welcome! My name is Uyen Huynh. I was born and raised in Vietnam and moved to the US around three years ago. Back in my hometown, I attended college, majoring in Linguistics. During my time in college, I found myself not having fun studying syntax, morphology, and phonetics of a language. I couldnâ€™t visualize myself doing that from 9 to 5 every day in the future. On the other hand, I always know that I enjoy taking photos and videos and editing them. I consider that as a way for me to document my life so I can look back on it in the future, and I have been doing that for six years. Also, I like drawing artworks and gifting them to my friends on special occasions such as birthdays or wedding days. Currently, my works carry a cartoon-minimalist aesthetic. When creating artwork, I want to be able to express my character and personality through my art. I can see myself sitting long hours to draw, edit videos or create a model on the computer. Compared to analyzing a sentence,  I cherish every moment I spent making art. <br>
I work with diverse media to create artwork. So far, I have tried Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop,  Illustrator, Procreate, and Maya. I am learning how to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and getting to know Adobe XD as well. Moving forward, I hope to have opportunities to learn new aspects of Digital Media Art. I want to put myself in the gaming field, such as creating characters or designing interactive games. I believe digital media has expanded rapidly and still growing strong in the future. Years from today, I hope that I can still continue documenting my life the way I am doing right now and find the audience for my artworks.
